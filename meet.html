            Hi. Through my many memorable years of crafting, I have gained quite a reputation for myself.
            And although you may know who I am and where I live (in the Mariana Trench), you might not know my story.
            My name is John Johnson, founder and CEO of Chronicles of Cake, better known by my online alias,
            "poopfartguy30". I was born on July 3rd, 1995 inside of a burning building. Throughout my early years, I enjoyed many a sport,
            such as bike riding, mountain climbing, men's swimming, women's basketball, bike riding, and more. But, in September of 2001,
            things were about to take a dark turn; as my beloved friend, my companion, my partner, my pet goldfish, drowned. It was the worst
            thing to happen that month. My life began spiraling out of control, and I turned to video game,
            to cheer me up. Then I swam to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and that is where I preside today.
            Please send help, it is very dark down here.
